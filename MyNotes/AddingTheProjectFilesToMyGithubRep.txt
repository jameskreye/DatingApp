-------------Adding gitHub as repository to the project----------------

git init : initialize an empty git repository in the project folder which is DatingApp, but first we had to delete the git folder that angular 
			install automatically while creating the angular app from the cli. 
			
			now after i add everything from the project that i wanna keep track of. now i create a repository from my github account 
			and from the terminal i typed this : git remote add origin https://github.com/jameskreye/DatingApp.git
			
			up there in vsCode there is a section with 3 dots . i chose push to and this url : git remote add origin https://github.com/jameskreye/DatingApp.git
			pops up. and i entered my git account username and password.  and just refresh the githug repository to see the changes
			
			now everytime i add a file to the project , i have to commit the change with an optional message and push it to my github repository.
